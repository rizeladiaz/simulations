DESCRIPTION OF DATA 
===================
OBSERVATION 1 IN THE APT FILE
Target: Binary point source
        A0V star with K magnitude 7.5 and a faint companion with contrast difference
	of 8.5 magnitudes. (This is a dummy magnitude and does not match the actual
	magnitude of 2MASS J23062928-0502285.

Rob_AMI_DT.aptx: APT file for the simulations

ami_aperturePAoffset.png: This shows how Observation 2 was rotated with respect to
                          Bbservation 1. The radial separation of faint companion
			  displayed in this figure is much larger than the separation
			  in the simulated data.

COMMENTS:
[1]Noise sources in the simulated data: read noise, poisson noise, dark current,
   background
[2]Aperture PA Offset related keywords are not added to file headers
